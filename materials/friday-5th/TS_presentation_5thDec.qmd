# Introduction {.smaller}

**Why Capelin Survey Timing is Critical**

-   Capelin (*Mallotus villosus*) - keystone forage fish in Icelandic and Greenland ecosystems
-   Highly variable stock with boom-bust dynamics
-   Critical prey for cod, haddock, seabirds, and marine mammals

::: fragment
**The Challenge:** Capelin are highly mobile with complex seasonal migrations

**The Question:** When and where should we sample to get reliable abundance estimates?
:::

::: notes
Capelin timing is particularly critical because of their role in the ecosystem and the short assessment timeline needed for management decisions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The IEGJM Capelin Stock {.smaller}

**Stock Characteristics**

-   Short-lived (2-4 years)
-   Semelparous (spawn once and die)
-   Temperature-dependent distribution
-   Feeds on zooplankton (mainly copepods)
-   Spawns on south and southwest coasts

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Capelin Migration Patterns {.smaller}

**Seasonal Movements Around Iceland** ![](images/clipboard-611894884.png){fig-align="center" width="65%"}

-   **Summer:** North and east of Iceland (feeding)
-   **Autumn:** Widespread in Iceland-Greenland-Jan Mayen area
-   **Winter:** Migration toward spawning grounds
-   **Spring:** Concentrated on spawning grounds (south coast)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Survey Options: When to Sample?

**Three Main Survey Windows**

1.  **Summer Survey (June-July)**
    -   Feeding season
    -   Dispersed distribution
2.  **Autumn Survey (October)**
    -   Pre-spawning, maturing stock
3.  **Winter Survey (January-February)**
    -   Pre-spawning migration
    -   High aggregation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Winter Acoustic Survey {.smaller}

**Timing:** Mid-January to early February

**Rationale:**

-   Capelin migrating toward spawning grounds northwest to east of Iceland
-   **High density aggregations** (easier to detect acoustically) in open water
-   Sampling in shallow depths may pose problems as capelin may be very close to the bottom in some areas or above the depth zone.
-   Stock concentrated in smaller area (more efficient coverage)
-   Mature stock (target for fishery management)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Winter? Biological Advantages {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**High Catchability**

-   Dense schools
-   Predictable migration routes
-   Shallower depths
-   Less vertical migration (generally capelin is between )

**Mature Stock**

-   Clear age structure
-   Spawning stock biomass estimate
-   Maturity assessment possible

    -   Survey in January-February
    -   Assessment in February-March
    -   TAC set
-   **Focused Survey Area**
    -   Northwest to and northeast e.g  of Iceland
    -   Shorter survey duration (\~2 weeks)
    -   Lower vessel costs
-   **Management Relevance**
    -   Direct measure of spawning stock
    -   Timely advice for quota setting

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Challenge: Winter Weather {.smaller}

**Operational Constraints**

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Weather Risks:**

-   Storm frequency highest
-   Short daylight hours
-   Ice conditions (some years)

## Acoustic Detection of Capelin {.smaller}

**Technical Considerations**

**Frequency Selection:**

-   **38 kHz:** Standard for capelin surveys
-   Good penetration and detection
-   Clear separation from other species if we use multifrequency, namely krill at 120 kHz

![](images/clipboard-2201400622.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Challenges:**

::: incremental
::: {.column width="50%"}

-   Weak target strength (small fish or weak schools)

-   Multifrequency variability if predators are present (Héctor Peña, IMR work)

-   Dense schools can cause acoustic shadowing

-   Need to distinguish from other small pelagics (juveniles)

## Survey Design: Adaptive Strategy {.smaller}

**Systematic Parallel Transects**

![](images/clipboard-40640943.png){fig-align="center" width="65%"}



------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Base Design:**

-   East-west transects, 10 n.mi. spacing e.g.
-   Covers typical distribution area
-   Systematic coverage for abundance estimation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Adaptive Components:**

-   Additional transects in high-density areas
-   Extended coverage if distribution is wider than expected
-   Real-time decision making based on acoustic data and samples results

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Acoustic Registration Examples {.smaller}

**Reading Echograms: Key Patterns**

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**High-Density Registration:**

-   Strong backscatter (red/orange)
-   Depth: 50-200m
-   Dense aggregations
-   **Action: Prime fishing area**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Low-Density Registration:**

-   Weak scattered signals
-   Dispersed individuals
-   Mixed with noise
-   Difficult to target with the trawl
-   **Action: Move to better area**
:::
:::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## When to Fish: Acoustic Indicators {.smaller}

**Decision Criteria Based on Acoustic Data**

**✓ Good Indicators:**

::: incremental
-   **NASC values \> 1000 m²/nmi²** (high biomass density)
-   Dense, continuous schools on echogram
-   School depth: 50-150m (optimal trawling depth)
-   Clear species separation (38 kHz and multifrequency confirmation)
-   Stable acoustic marks (not just passing through)
:::

**✗ Poor Indicators:**

::: incremental
-   NASC \< 100 m²/nmi² (too dispersed)
-   Scattered weak signals
-   Very deep (\>250m) or surface schools
-   Mixed species signals
-   Highly mobile/transient registrations
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Real-Time Fishing Guidance {.smaller}
**Using Acoustic Data for Fleet Operations**
EK60 color scale for NASC values **Color-Coded Zones Based on NASC:**

-   🔴 **Red (NASC \> 2000):** Excellent fishing - deploy immediately
-   🟡 **Yellow (NASC 500-2000):** Moderate - selective fishing
-   🟢 **Green (NASC \< 500):** Poor - search for better areas

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Communication:**

-   Survey vessels share acoustic maps with fishing fleet
-   Real-time updates during winter fishery
-   Helps optimize catch efficiency and reduce bycatch (if any)

::: callout-important
## When in Doubt: TRAWL!
**Ground-Truthing Acoustic Data**

-   Acoustic signals can be ambiguous (capelin vs. herring juveniles, krill, etc.)
-   **Best practice:** Take trawl samples to verify species and size composition
-   Collect biological data: length, weight, maturity, age
-   Validate TS assumptions and improve acoustic interpretation
-   Better safe than sorry - prevents targeting wrong species or undersized fish
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Capelin School Characteristics {.smaller}

**Identifying Good Fishing Targets**

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Acoustic Signatures:**

-   **Target Strength (TS)**
-   **School depth:** Typically 50-200m during migration
-   **School shape:** Dense layers or columns
-   **Vertical extent:** 10-50m thick layers
-   **Movement:** Often stationary or slow-moving during day

Note that schools aggregations can vary between daytime and season

**Critical Window:** Only a few weeks from survey to TAC advice!

This tight timeline requires winter survey timing.
