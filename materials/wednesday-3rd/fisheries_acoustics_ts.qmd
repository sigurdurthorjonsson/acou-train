### What is Fisheries Acoustics?

-   Use of sound waves to detect and quantify fish populations and their habitats.

-   Non-invasive method for monitoring aquatic ecosystems.![](images/clipboard-4040616178.png)

## Key components of Fisheries Acoustics

### Acoustic Equipment

-   Echosounders: devices that emit sound pulses and receive echoes. ![](images/clipboard-1949668006.png){width="372"}
-   Hydrophones: underwater microphones for detecting sound.
-   Transducers: convert electrical signals into sound waves and vice versa.

## Applications of Fisheries Acoustics
**Fish Stock Assessment**
-   Monitoring fish populations and biomass.
-   Estimating fish population sizes and distributions.
-   Informing sustainable fisheries management.
**Habitat Mapping**
-   Identifying critical habitats for fish species.
-   Monitoring changes in habitat over time.

**Behavioral Studies**
-   Observing fish behavior in response to environmental changes.
-   Understanding migration patterns and spawning activities.
**Data Collection** 
-   Deployment of acoustic equipment from boats or fixed platforms.
-   Collection of acoustic signals reflected from fish and other underwater objects.

## Acoustic Principles in Fisheries

### Sound Propagation in Water

-   Sound travels faster in water than in air (approximately 1500 m/s).
-   Influenced by temperature, salinity, and pressure.
-   Attenuation: loss of sound energy as it travels through water.

### Acoustic Backscatter
-   Reflection of sound waves off fish and other objects.
-   Backscatter strength depends on fish size, shape, and orientation.
-   Used to estimate fish density and biomass.

## Importance of Calibration
-   Ensures accuracy and reliability of acoustic measurements.
-   Compensates for environmental factors affecting sound propagation.
-   Essential for comparing data across different surveys and time periods.

## Calibration Techniques
### Standard Calibration Methods
-   Use of reference targets (e.g., spheres) with known acoustic properties.
-   Calibration of transducers to ensure consistent output.

### In-situ Calibration
-   Calibration performed in the field using known targets.
-   Accounts for environmental conditions during data collection.

### Post-Processing Calibration
-   Adjusting data based on calibration results.
-   Correcting for system drift and environmental changes.


## Consequences of Poor Calibration
### Data Inaccuracy
-   Misestimation of fish populations and distributions.
-   Inconsistent results across different surveys.

### Misguided Management Decisions
-   Inaccurate data can lead to overfishing or under-protection of fish stocks.
-   Impacts on conservation efforts and ecosystem health.


## NASC and Gain Relationship
### Understanding NASC (Nautical Area Scattering Coefficient)
-   NASC represents the integrated backscatter from fish in a nautical square mile.
-   Directly proportional to fish density and biomass.
-   Formula: NASC = ∫ sv dA (integration of volume backscattering coefficient)

### Gain and NASC Relationship
-   Gain settings affect the received signal strength.
-   Improper gain calibration leads to systematic bias in NASC values.
-   **Example**: A 1 dB gain error can result in \~26% error in biomass estimates.




## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Successful Calibration
-   A fisheries survey that accurately estimated fish biomass due to proper calibration.
-   Resulted in effective management strategies for sustainable fishing.



### Case Study 2: Poor Calibration Consequences
-   A survey that underestimated fish populations due to lack of calibration.
-   Led to overfishing and subsequent population decline.

## Conclusion
### Summary
-   Fisheries acoustics is a vital tool for monitoring aquatic ecosystems.
-   Calibration is crucial for ensuring accurate and reliable data.

### Future Directions
-   Advancements in technology for improved acoustic measurements.
-   Integration with other monitoring methods for comprehensive ecosystem assessments.
