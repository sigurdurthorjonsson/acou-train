## Introduction {.smaller}

**Why Capelin Survey Timing is Critical**

- Capelin (*Mallotus villosus*) - keystone forage fish in North Atlantic
- Highly variable stock with boom-bust dynamics
- Critical prey for cod, haddock, seabirds, and marine mammals

::: {.fragment}
**The Challenge:** Capelin are highly mobile with complex seasonal migrations

**The Question:** When and where should we sample to get reliable abundance estimates?
:::

::: {.notes}
Capelin timing is particularly critical because of their role in the ecosystem and the short assessment timeline needed for management decisions.

## Capelin Life Cycle

![](images/capelin_life_cycle.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

**Annual Cycle:**

- **Spring (Mar-May):** Spawning migration and spawning
- **Summer (Jun-Aug):** Feeding in open ocean
- **Autumn (Sep-Nov):** Feeding and maturation
- **Winter (Dec-Feb):** Pre-spawning migration begins

## The Icelandic Capelin Stock {.smaller}

**Stock Characteristics**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Short-lived (2-4 years)
- Semelparous (spawn once and die)
- Temperature-dependent distribution
- Feeds on zooplankton (mainly copepods)
- Spawns on south and southwest coasts
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

*Typical distribution areas by season*
:::

::: {.callout-important}
Stock size varies dramatically (0.5 to 3+ million tonnes)

## Capelin Migration Patterns {.smaller}

**Seasonal Movements Around Iceland**

![](images/capelin_migration_map.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

- **Summer:** North and east of Iceland (feeding)
- **Autumn:** Widespread in Iceland-Greenland-Jan Mayen area
- **Winter:** Migration toward spawning grounds
- **Spring:** Concentrated on spawning grounds (south coast)

::: {.fragment}
**Key Insight:** Distribution changes dramatically throughout the year
:::

---

## Survey Options: When to Sample?

**Three Main Survey Windows**

1. **Summer Survey (June-July)**
   - Feeding season
   - Dispersed distribution
   
2. **Autumn Survey (October)**
   - Pre-spawning, maturing stock
   - Moderate aggregation

3. **Winter Survey (January-February)**
   - Pre-spawning migration
   - High aggregation

---

## Winter Acoustic Survey {.smaller}

**The Icelandic Approach**

![](images/capelin_winter_survey_track.png){fig-align="center" width="65%"}

**Timing:** Mid-January to early February

**Rationale:**

- Capelin migrating toward spawning grounds
- **High density aggregations** (easier to detect acoustically)
- Stock concentrated in smaller area (more efficient coverage)
- Mature stock (target for fishery management)

---

## Why Winter? Biological Advantages {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**High Catchability**

- Dense schools
- Predictable migration routes
- Shallower depths
- Less vertical migration

**Mature Stock**

## Acoustic Detection of Capelin {.smaller}

**Technical Considerations**

![](images/Sine_waves_different_frequencies.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

**Frequency Selection:**

- **38 kHz:** Standard for capelin surveys
- Good penetration and detection
- Clear separation from other species

**Challenges:**

- Small target strength (small fish)
- Dense schools can cause acoustic shadowing
- Need to distinguish from other small pelagics (herring juveniles)

---

## Survey Design: Adaptive Strategy {.smaller}

**Systematic Parallel Transects**

![](images/capelin_transect_design.png){fig-align="center" width="65%"}

**Base Design:**

- East-west transects, 30 n.mi. spacing
- Covers typical distribution area
- Systematic coverage for abundance estimation

**Adaptive Components:**

- Additional transects in high-density areas
- Extended coverage if distribution is wider than expected
**#add figures of possible extentions **

- Real-time decision making based on acoustic data

---

## Temperature and Capelin Distribution {.smaller}

**Environmental Influence on Timing**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Cold Years:** 
  - Later migration
  - More southern distribution
  - May need to extend survey south

- **Warm Years:**
  - Earlier migration
  - More northern spawning
  - Different spatial coverage needed

**Climate Change:** Warming trend affecting timing

## Multi-Year Consistency {.smaller}

**Importance of Consistent Timing**

**Benefits:**

- Comparable time series (1978-present)
- Reliable trend detection
- Reduced bias in assessment
- Historical data valuable for modeling

**Challenges:**

- Weather may force delays (±1 week)
- Stock distribution changes
- Must balance consistency with data quality

## Assessment Timeline {.smaller}

**From Survey to Management**

```
January-February:  Winter Acoustic Survey
        ↓
February:          Data processing and QC
        ↓
